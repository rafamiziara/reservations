# Reservations

The API should enable a client to create users (name and email address will suffice) and reservations.

- Users must be unique by their email address and they must be in relation with reservations.

- The client should be also able to fetch the list of existing reservations given a date range.
- Paginated result for the reservation list.

- For simplicity, we assume that the restaurant has five tables each with four seats, seating time is one hour and the restaurant is opened every day between 19:00 and 24:00.
